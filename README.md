# GoBang
This is the project of my end-of-semester task in the course C programming language.
(How could it be that hard! Huh?! (x))

Although this project is constructed by CMake, you can easily build it by following command:

```linux shell
gcc -o <target_name> -std=c99 <resource_files> -DNONE_DEBUG_DRAW -lm
```
